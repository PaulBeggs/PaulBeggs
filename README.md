### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently working on making a Linear Algebra Calculator using Java and IntelliJ.
  
- I am not actively looking for additional help on my projects, but if you think there is something you could contribute, please don't hesitate to contact me!
  
- Speaking of, my contact information is paulbeggs03@gmail.com. Feel free to email me at anytime. I check my email daily.
  
- Some facts about me:
  + I am currently a student at Hendrix College.
  + I am pursuing a double major with Mathematics and Psychology.
  + My dream is to become a Clinical Psychologist.
    
- Backstory:
  + I got into coding on my own after a Data Structures class. In my final project, I used Java in combination with SceneBuilder to make an UI that is designed to help students; though, at the time of presentation, I was not happy with the end result -- I know it could be better. So, I have been working on improving it ever since.
    Currently, it is still private because I am worried that my project may be copied without permission, and I do not know enough about code protection to feel confident, yet.
